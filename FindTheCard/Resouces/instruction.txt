Two game modes:
One card game and three card game



-  One card game
We have 1 deck of cards and 9 signs. We don't know what the next card is, so we have to guess it!
You have to drag the traits onto the trait board. You can choose only one feature from each category.
To place a bet, click the "Place a bet" button.
Choose the required number of coins for each bet. The total number of coins can be seen above. Click "Play"!
The card is opened. If one of the signs is true, the coins placed on this sign are doubled, otherwise the coins are taken away.
After that, we place bets until we lose all the coins or reach 100!

-  Three Card Game
We have 3 decks of cards and 9 signs. We don't know what the next card is, so we have to guess it!
You need to drag the signs to the sign board. You can only choose one trait from each category.
To place a bet, click the "Place a bet" button.
Choose the required number of coins for each bet. The total number of coins can be seen above. Click "Play"!
3 cards are revealed. If. A certain sign appears on the cards once - we get our money back, if it appears 2 times - we double our winnings, if it appears 3 times - we triple them. And so on for each of the selected signs
After that, we place bets until we lose all our coins or reach 100!
